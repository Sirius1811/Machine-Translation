# Machine-Translation
This project implements a transformer model for language translation, following the "Attention is All You Need" framework. It leverages self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing to efficiently handle sequence-to-sequence tasks, aiming to achieve accurate translations while minimizing computational overhead.
